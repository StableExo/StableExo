# AI-Crypto-Ecosystem

A self-funding, autonomous AI development ecosystem. This project combines advanced AI modules (NLP, Computer Vision, Reinforcement Learning) with decentralized finance (DeFi) strategies to generate income that funds its own research and development.

## Project Status
ðŸš§ **Early Development** - This project is currently under active construction in its initial phases.

## Structure
This repository is organized as follows:
*   `ai_modules/` - Code for AI models and training scripts.
*   `smart_contracts/` - Solidity code for Ethereum-based tokens and DeFi protocols.
*   `scripts/` - Utility scripts for deployment, training, and automation.
*   `data/` - Datasets for training and analysis (git-ignored by default).
*   `tests/` - Unit and integration tests.

## Getting Started
