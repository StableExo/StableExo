# StableExo Project Roadmap

## Vision
To create a fully autonomous, self-funding artificial intelligence system that sustains its own development and operation through decentralized finance (DeFi) strategies.

## Phase 1: Foundation (Target Date: 2024-10-31)
- [x] Create GitHub repository with organized folder structure.
- [x] Define project roadmap and goals.
- [ ] Set up Python development environment with virtualenv.
- [x] Draft initial README.md.

## Phase 2: Core AI Development (Target Date: 2024-12-15)
- [ ] Develop and train a basic NLP model for sentiment analysis.
- [ ] Develop and train a basic Computer Vision model for chart pattern recognition.
- [ ] Develop a basic Reinforcement Learning agent in a simulated environment.

## Phase 3: Crypto Integration (Target Date: 2025-01-31)
- [ ] Write and deploy an ERC-20 token contract to a testnet.
- [ ] Develop a simple yield farming or staking contract.
- [ ] Build a script to connect an AI model to a crypto exchange API (testnet).

## Phase 4: Autonomous Operation (Target Date: 2025-03-15)
- [ ] Integrate an AI module with a live trading strategy on testnet.
- [ ] Implement a reinvestment mechanism for generated yield.

## Phase 5: Scaling and DAO (Target Date: 2025-04-30)
